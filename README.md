# Canopy Hiring Challenge
## Background
This repo is to help avoid the setup of the Canopy hiring challenge. It includes
a few helpful libraries to get you setup quickly. Read the commit history to see
what was added.

* Preconfigured to use Postgres (like the [RubyGems Data Dump](https://rubygems.org/pages/data))
* Support for bootstrap 3 and jquery

Removing anything should be as simple as git revert.

## Requirements
* Ruby 2.6.6
* Rails 6.0.3
* Postgres

If you need to install Ruby, the easiest way is [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation). After that, `gem install rails -v 6.0.3`. To install Postgres on Ubuntu, follow their [official](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/). For OS X, [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) is the probably the simplest but you can use (Homebrew)[https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgres-sql-macos-setup] too.
